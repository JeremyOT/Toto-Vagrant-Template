Clone this repo.\r\n2. From the project directory run the command `vagrant up`.\r\n3. Wait for [Vagrant][vagrant] to configure the VM\r\n\r\nOnce you've completed these steps, the contents of the `static` directory will be hosted by [Nginx][nginx] at `http://42.42.42.42`.\r\nBy default, this is a blank page with a few script tags to get you set up with [toto.js][totojs]. The service in the `service`\r\ndirectory will be listening at `http://42.42.42.42/service`. You can shutdown the environment with `vagrant halt` from anywhere in the\r\nproject directory structure. Run `vagrant` without any arguments for a list of available commands.\r\n\r\nCommands\r\n--------\r\n\r\nThere are a few special commands available to help you out:\r\n\r\n- `vagrant toto <command>` - Passes `<command>` to your [Toto][toto] service so you can easily `--restart` after you make changes (or run your service with other options). This command actually runs `service/services.sh`, which acts as a proxy to your [Toto][toto] service and makes it easy to manage multiple services simultaneously.\r\n- `vagrant nginx <signal>` - Calls `nginx -s <signal>` in the VM. In the special case where `<signal>` is `start`, this will call `nginx`.\r\n\r\nAdditional Setup\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nAlong with the usual [Vagrant][vagrant] configuration and customization available to you, there are a few shortcuts to make basic configuration a bit easier.\r\n\r\n- The `nginx-conf` directory is simlinked to the usual Ubuntu `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled` directory for easy [Nginx][nginx] setup.\r\n- `setup-files/setup.sql` will be run after [MySQL][mysql] is installed in the dev environment to facilitate database creation and test data population.\r\n- `setup-files/python.sh` will be run after [pip][pip] is installed so that you can install any extra packages or modules your service requires.\r\n- Finally, `setup-files/post-setup.sh` will run after all other steps are complete for any final cleanup.\r\n\r\n_Note: all scripts are run in the VM as root._\r\n\r\nFor more advanced setup, check out the documentation for [Vagrant][vagrantdocs] and [Toto][totodocs].\r\n\r\n[vb]:https://www.virtualbox.org/\r\n[vagrant]:http://www.vagrantup.com/\r\n[vagrantdocs]:http://docs.vagrantup.com/v1/docs/index.html\r\n[pip]:http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip\r\n[nginx]:http://wiki.nginx.org\r\n[mysql]:http://www.mysql.com/\r\n[toto]:https://github.com/JeremyOT/Toto\r\n[totojs]:https://github.com/JeremyOT/TotoClient-JS\r\n[totodocs]:http://jeremyot.com/Toto/docs/\r\n","google":""}
